# IAM (Incremental Ant-miner) is an incremental model based on Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) miner algorithm for classification rule discovery. This Ant- Miner algorithm is known for its effectiveness in approaching challenging optimization problems as well as on association rules mining. The project is developed to avoid running the algorithm repeatedly as some datasets are available gradually. it is implemented based on myra algorithm, which is an open-source Java framework, provides the implementation of several ant colony optimization algorithms for the data mining classification and regression tasks. This project has great potential in helping the decision makers  in handling problems and making intelligent decisions in different fields.
